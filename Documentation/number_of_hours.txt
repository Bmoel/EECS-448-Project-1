File to store the team's thoughts on the number of hours requires to finish the project

Jiayi Fu estimate - 30hrs
Samuel Jerguson estimmate - 35hrs
Alec Mcglynn estimate - 30hrs
Benjamin Moeller estimate - 40hrs
Blake Richmeier estimate - 30hrs

Average Hours Estimate - 33hrs

How we got to that conclusion:
We each got to the estimate by taking how many hours previous hours have taken, and then multiplying it by the number of people
So for example if we thought that each person would need to spend eight hours on the project, 8*5 would be 40 hours
Overall since this is our first project, we are ultimately just making an educated guess
Future projects will likely have more accurate estimates
